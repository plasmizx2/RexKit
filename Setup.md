# RexKit Repository Setup Guide

Welcome to the RexKit project\! This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment, cloning the repository, understanding its structure, and contributing effectively.

## 1\. Getting Started: Installing Git and VS Code

Before we begin, you'll need two essential tools: Git (for version control) and Visual Studio Code (VS Code, our preferred code editor).

### 1.1 Install Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows us to track changes in our code and collaborate efficiently.

1.  **Download Git:** Go to the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **Follow Installation Instructions:**
      * **Windows:** Download the installer and run it. You can generally accept the default options during installation.
      * **macOS:** You can install Git via Homebrew (`brew install git`) or by downloading the installer.
      * **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo yum install git` for Fedora/RHEL).
3.  **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
    You should see the installed Git version.

### 1.2 Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is a powerful and lightweight code editor with excellent Git integration.

1.  **Download VS Code:** Go to the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  **Follow Installation Instructions:** Download the installer for your operating system and run it. Again, default options are usually fine.
3.  **Open VS Code:** Once installed, open VS Code.

## 2\. Setting Up VS Code with GitHub

To streamline your workflow, it's highly recommended to sign into GitHub directly within VS Code.

1.  **Open the Source Control View:** In VS Code, click on the **Source Control** icon in the Activity Bar on the left (it looks like three interconnected circles).
2.  **Sign in to GitHub:** If you haven't already, VS Code will prompt you to sign in to GitHub. Click on **"Sign in to GitHub"** and follow the on-screen instructions to authorize VS Code with your GitHub account. This will allow you to easily clone repositories, push changes, and manage branches directly from VS Code.

## 3\. Cloning the RexKit Repository

Now, let's get a copy of the RexKit project onto your local machine.

1.  **Open Command Palette:** In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.
2.  **Type "Git: Clone":** Start typing "Git: Clone" and select the `Git: Clone` command.
3.  **Enter Repository URL:** When prompted for the Repository URL, paste the following:
    ```
    https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/RexKit.git
    ```
    **(Important: Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username or the organization name if the repo is under an organization.)**
4.  **Choose a Local Folder:** Select a directory on your computer where you want to store the RexKit project. VS Code will then clone the repository into that folder.
5.  **Open Cloned Repository:** After cloning, VS Code will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Click **"Open"**.

## 4\. Understanding Your Repository Structure

Let's take a quick look at the files and folders you'll see in the `RexKit` repository:

```
RexKit/
├── env/                     # (Likely a virtual environment folder - explained below)
├── gmail_api/               # (Likely a module for Gmail API integration)
├── README.md                # This file! Provides an overview and setup instructions.
├── roadMap.md               # Outlines future plans and features for the project.
├── .env                     # (Contains environment variables - explained below)
└── .gitignore               # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
```

## 5\. Branching Out: Creating Your Own Branch

It's crucial to work on your own branch when contributing. This keeps the main development line (`main` or `master`) clean and allows for easy merging of your changes.

1.  **Open Source Control View:** Go back to the Source Control view in VS Code (the three interconnected circles icon).
2.  **Click on the Branch Name:** At the bottom left of the VS Code window, you'll see the current branch name (likely `main`). Click on it.
3.  **Create New Branch:** In the pop-up at the top, select **"Create New Branch..."**.
4.  **Name Your Branch:** Enter a descriptive name for your branch. Good branch names often follow a pattern like `feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`. For example: `feature/gmail-integration-improvements`.
5.  **Press Enter:** Your new branch will be created and you'll automatically switch to it.

Now, any changes you make will be on your new branch, not directly on `main`.

## 6\. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that holds a specific version of Python and all the project's dependencies. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your machine and ensures everyone is working with the same setup.

### 6.1 Why use a Virtual Environment?

  * **Isolation:** Prevents conflicts between different Python projects.
  * **Dependency Management:** Ensures all collaborators use the exact same package versions.
  * **Cleanliness:** Keeps global Python installations clean.

### 6.2 Steps to Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

1.  **Open VS Code Terminal:** In VS Code, go to `Terminal > New Terminal`.

2.  **Navigate to Project Root:** Ensure your terminal is in the `RexKit` project root directory.

3.  **Create Virtual Environment:**

      * **Python 3.x (Recommended):**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        ```
        This creates a folder named `env` (or whatever you choose) containing the virtual environment.
      * **If `python3` doesn't work, try `python`:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        ```

4.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**

      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

    You'll know it's active when you see `(env)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

5.  **Install Dependencies:** Once the virtual environment is active, you can install any project dependencies. You'll likely have a `requirements.txt` file in a real project. If so, you'd run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **(Note: If there's no `requirements.txt` yet, don't worry about this step for now.)**

### 6.3 Configuring VS Code to Use the Virtual Environment

VS Code is usually smart enough to detect your activated virtual environment. If not:

1.  **Open Command Palette:** `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2.  **Type "Python: Select Interpreter":** Select the command `Python: Select Interpreter`.
3.  **Choose Your Virtual Environment:** Select the Python interpreter located inside your `env` folder (e.g., `.\env\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows or `env/bin/python` on macOS/Linux).

## 7\. Understanding `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file is a plain text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing changes to the repository. This is crucial for keeping our repository clean and avoiding unnecessary clutter.

### 7.1 Why do we use `.gitignore`?

  * **Temporary Files:** Ignore compiled code, logs, cache files.
  * **Environment-Specific Files:** Ignore files generated by your IDE or operating system (e.g., `.DS_Store` on macOS).
  * **Sensitive Information:** **Crucially, it's used to ignore files containing sensitive information like API keys or credentials, such as your `.env` file.**

### 7.2 What's in `RexKit/.gitignore`?

Here's an example of what might be in your `.gitignore` for the RexKit project:

```
# Environment variables
.env

# Virtual environment
env/

# IDE files
.vscode/

# Python compiled files
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Operating System specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
```

**Explanation of common entries:**

  * `.env`: This line tells Git to ignore the `.env` file. This is where you store sensitive information like API keys for `gmail_api`. **NEVER commit your `.env` file to GitHub\!**
  * `env/`: This ignores the entire virtual environment folder. Your collaborators will create their own `env` folder, so there's no need to track this in Git.
  * `.vscode/`: Ignores VS Code's workspace settings, which are personal to each developer.
  * `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`: These are Python compiled bytecode files, which are temporary and can be regenerated.
  * `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`: Operating system-specific files that have no place in the repository.

## 8\. Setting Up `.env` (Environment Variables)

The `.env` file is where you'll store sensitive configuration details that should not be committed to source control (like API keys, secret keys, etc.). The `gmail_api` module will likely need some credentials, and these should go in your `.env` file.

### 8.1 How to create your `.env` file:

1.  **Create the file:** In the root of your `RexKit` directory, create a new file named `.env` (make sure it starts with a dot).

2.  **Add your variables:** Inside this `.env` file, you'll add key-value pairs for your environment variables. For example, if your `gmail_api` needs a `GMAIL_API_KEY`:

    ```
    # .env
    GMAIL_API_KEY=your_actual_gmail_api_key_here
    ```

    **(Replace `your_actual_gmail_api_key_here` with your real key.)**

3.  **Load environment variables:** Your Python code will typically use a library like `python-dotenv` to load these variables. Make sure the relevant code is in place to read from `.env`.

**Remember: The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` for a reason. It should never be pushed to GitHub\!**

## 9\. What's Next?

  * **Explore `roadMap.md`:** Check out `roadMap.md` to understand the project's vision and upcoming features.
  * **Dive into the Code:** Start exploring the `gmail_api` module and other parts of the project.
  * **Make Changes:** Make your desired changes on your newly created branch.
  * **Commit and Push:** When you're ready, commit your changes and push them to your branch on GitHub.
  * **Create a Pull Request:** Once your changes are complete, create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub from your branch to the `main` branch to get your changes reviewed and merged.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask\! Happy coding\!
